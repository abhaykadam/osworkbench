	Implemented by Abhirup Ghosh (M.Tech, CSE, IITB)

HOW TO COMPILE AND RUN
----------------------
	Run run.sh file with appropriate parameteres.
	Format -
		- $>./run.sh <OSSpecfile location> <OSInitile location> <Type of execution: demo/instrumented>


DIRECTORY STRUCTURE

	Program Instrumentation - Contains scripts for instrumenting a C program to run in the system
	test
		|---proc - Directory contains dummy user programs
		|---proc_C - Directory contains C source files for using them as processes
